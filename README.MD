## 🤖 Bonus Project – Jarvis Voice Assistant  

Inside this repo, there’s a **Jarvis Folder** containing a simple Python-based voice assistant.  

### Features:  
✅ Opens Google, LinkedIn, and YouTube  
✅ Plays music from a custom music library  
✅ Fetches live news using NewsAPI  
✅ Listens for your command and responds with speech  

### How to Run:
```bash
cd Jarvis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python jarvis.py
````

Make sure to add your own **News API Key** in the `.env` file:

```
API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
```
