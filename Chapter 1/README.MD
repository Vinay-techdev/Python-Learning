# 📖 Chapter 01 – Python Basics

This chapter introduces the very first steps into Python programming, covering essential concepts and hands-on exercises.

# 🖥️ Topics Covered
1. First Python Program

- Wrote and executed the classic print("Hello, World!") program.
- Learned how Python code runs line by line (interpreted language).
- Explored how .py files are created and executed in a terminal or IDE.

2. Python Module – pyjokes

- Discovered Python modules (pre-written code libraries that we can use).
- Installed and used the pyjokes module to generate programming-related jokes.

3. PIP – Python Package Manager
- Learned about pip (Python’s package installer).
- Installed external libraries
- Example commands:

``` bash 
pip install pyjokes
pip list
pip uninstall pyjokes
```

4. REPL – Read-Eval-Print Loop

- Used Python’s interactive shell (REPL).
- Understood how REPL allows quick testing of code line by line.

5. Comments in Python

- Learned how to add comments to make code more readable.

# 🏋️‍♂️ Practice Set

- Text-to-Speech with pyttsx3
- Installed and used the pyttsx3 module to convert text to speech.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- Understood the basics of writing and running Python code.
- Learned to install and use external modules with pip.
- Got hands-on experience with interactive Python using REPL.
- Practiced writing readable code with comments.
- Implemented a fun mini-project: text-to-speech converter.
