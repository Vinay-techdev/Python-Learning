# 📘 Chapter 06 – Conditional Statements & Loops

This chapter covers **decision making** and **repeating tasks** in Python.  

---

# 1. Conditional Expressions (Decision Making)

- Conditional statements help Python decide what to do based on conditions.

- **if** → Runs if condition is True
- **elif** → Extra condition (used after if)
- **else** → Runs if no condition matches

---

# 📌 Key Points:

- Conditions use comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Multiple conditions can be combined with and / or

---

# 2. Loops (Repetition)

- Loops are used when we want to repeat something multiple times.

- **For Loop** - Used when we know how many times to repeat.
- **While Loop** - Used when we don’t know how many times but have a condition to stop.


-⚠️ Always make sure condition will become False one day, else it runs forever (infinite loop).

---

# Loop Control Statements

- Sometimes we want to control loop flow:

- **continue** → Skip the current iteration and go to next
- **break** → Stop the loop completely

| Keyword            | Use                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `if / elif / else` | Decision making              |
| `for`              | Repeat with known range      |
| `while`            | Repeat until condition false |
| `continue`         | Skip current iteration       |
| `break`            | Exit loop completely         |
